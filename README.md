# Optical_Communication
Algorithms in Matlab used for Waveguide Propagation calculations and analysis. Detailed explanations regarding coding and results are included in main.mlx files (in Spanish)
The structure of the repo is the following:

### 1. Bisection Method Algorithm
In this folder, the bisection method algorithm is developed in order to find solutions inside an interval (according to ). This method will be used for waveguide propagation analysis.

### 2. Waveguide propagation
In this folder, Helmholtz equation algorithm for guided modes in a fiber is developed, using the bisection method algorithm, as well as modal radious and confinement factors are calculated. As a result, different b-V propagation mode curves are obtained:
